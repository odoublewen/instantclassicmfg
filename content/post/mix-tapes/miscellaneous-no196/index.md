Listening to Marvin Gaye sing the National Anthem this evening --
the eve of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, and, perversely, also the
inauguration of President Trump's second term -- I cannot help but
mourn America's lost potential.  It seemed we were so close -- at
least I believed so, in my youthful naivety.
